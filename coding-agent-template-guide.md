# Coding Agent Template Integration Guide

This project consumes the upstream template stored one level above the repo at `../coding-agent-template`. Follow the rules below whenever you touch or extend any of the coding agent functionality.

## Core Rules

- **MUST** inspect `../coding-agent-template` before implementing new features or updating bugs that live under `lib/coding-agent`, `app/builder`, or related surfaces.
- **MUST** track upstream changes (docs, components, scripts) and decide whether they need to be adopted here; log the decision in pull request notes.
- **MUST** prefer copy-syncing from the template over rewriting large sections by hand to preserve parity.
- **MUST** document any intentional deviations from the template in this file so future updates stay consistent.
- **SHOULD** check the template's `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `scripts/` for new capabilities before starting work.
- **SHOULD** run the sync script to identify discrepancies before and after changes.
- **SHOULD** open a tracking issue if upstream work cannot be adopted immediately.
- **NEVER** update coding-agent code paths in this repo without first confirming how the same area behaves upstream.

## Update Workflow

1. **Run Sync Analysis**: Execute `node scripts/sync-coding-agent-template.js` to get current sync status
2. **Review Report**: Check `coding-agent-sync-report.json` for missing, outdated, or ignored files
3. **Identify Changes**: Open `../coding-agent-template` in your editor and identify files to update
4. **Compare Files**: Use `git diff`, `meld`, or your preferred diff viewer to compare upstream vs downstream
5. **Port Updates**: Copy over updates, adjusting imports, environment variables, and paths as needed
6. **Verify Sync**: Re-run `node scripts/sync-coding-agent-template.js` to verify changes
7. **Test Changes**: Run local smoke tests (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm dev`) for affected areas
8. **Document Deviations**: Record any deliberate differences between upstream and downstream in this guide
9. **Update Status**: Mention in your PR description that you followed the steps in `coding-agent-template-guide.md`

Keeping this workflow tight ensures Social Forge stays aligned with improvements shipped in the shared coding agent template.

## Sync Tracking Tools

### Sync Script
Use `scripts/sync-coding-agent-template.js` to analyze the current state of template integration:

```bash
node scripts/sync-coding-agent-template.js
```

This script compares Social Forge with the upstream template and generates a detailed report showing:
- **Missing files**: Template files not found in Social Forge
- **Outdated files**: Template files newer than Social Forge versions
- **Up-to-date files**: Files that are synchronized
- **Ignored files**: Files intentionally excluded due to architectural differences

### Sync Report
The script generates `coding-agent-sync-report.json` with detailed analysis including:
- File-by-file comparison results
- Path mapping verification
- Summary statistics
- Extra Social Forge files not in template

### Path Mappings
The sync script uses `PATH_MAPPINGS` in `scripts/sync-coding-agent-template.js` to translate upstream paths to Social Forge locations. Key mappings include:
- `app/tasks` → `app/builder/tasks`
- `lib/` → `lib/coding-agent/` (for most files)
- `components/` → `components/builder/` (for builder-specific components)
- Shared utilities remain in `lib/` (e.g., `lib/github-stars.ts`, `lib/utils.ts`)

## Current Deviations

- The Builder experience in this repo lives under `app/builder/**` and `lib/coding-agent/**` (renamed from the template's `app/tasks/**` and `lib/**` structure). Maintain parity when upstream files move by mirroring the intent, not necessarily the exact path.
- Legacy `app/api/builder/tasks-api/**` routes from the template (Drizzle-based) have been removed in favor of the Prisma-backed endpoints under `app/api/builder/tasks/**`. Future upstream changes in those areas should be ported into the Prisma implementations.
- AI-generated branch naming now mirrors the template via `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` and the `lib/coding-agent/branch-names.ts` helper. When the key is absent or generation fails, tasks fall back to timestamped `agent/...` branch names captured in task logs.
- Builder landing experience mirrors the upstream layout, including GitHub OAuth, owner/repo selection, and deploy controls.
- **Authentication**: Uses `better-auth` instead of custom session management (upstream uses Jotai atoms for session state, we use better-auth OAuth with direct state management for compatibility with existing auth system).
- **State Management**: Now uses Jotai atoms matching upstream exactly (upstream uses Jotai for all state management including tasks and sidebar state).
- **Layout Architecture**: Now follows upstream's direct `AppLayoutWrapper` + `AppLayout` pattern exactly (upstream AppLayout manages its own state and provides context to children).
- **Route Structure**: Now matches upstream exactly with `/builder` as the main route (equivalent to upstream `/`), `/builder/tasks/[taskId]` for task details, and `/builder/repos/*` for repository management.
- **Component Organization**: All builder components now follow upstream structure exactly, with proper Jotai integration and context usage.
- **API Session Handling**: All builder task APIs use `auth.api.getSession({ headers })` instead of upstream's custom session utilities to work with better-auth.
- **Session Utilities**: The `lib/coding-agent/session.ts` file has been adapted to use better-auth's `auth.api.getSession()` instead of NextAuth's `getServerSession()`.
- **OAuth Integration**: GitHub sign-in uses better-auth's `signIn.social()` method instead of manual redirects to ensure proper OAuth flow and redirect handling.
- **GitHub Token Management**: Updated GitHub token retrieval to use better-auth's `Account` table instead of `BuilderApiKey` table, ensuring proper OAuth token access for GitHub API calls.
- **API Response Structure**: Fixed GitHub repos API to return `{ repos: Repo[] }` structure expected by the RepoSelector component, preventing runtime errors.
- **Sandbox Timeout Limits**: Updated sandbox timeout configuration to respect Vercel's maximum limit of 45 minutes, preventing 400 errors during sandbox creation.
- **File Diff Viewer Error Handling**: Simplified error handling in FileDiffViewer to match upstream template, removing complex sandbox fallback logic that was causing issues.
- **Sandbox File Reading**: Updated file-content API to normalize file paths and add proper error handling for sandbox file operations, matching upstream implementation.
- **API Route Paths**: Updated task form API key check endpoint to use `/api/builder/api-keys/check` instead of `/api/api-keys/check` to match Social Forge's builder API route structure.
- **Component Naming**: Fixed HomePageContent component export/import to match upstream exactly, resolving "Element type is invalid" errors.
- **Array Safety**: Added proper array safety checks in RepoSelector to prevent "map is not a function" errors.
- **Locale Consistency**: Fixed hydration mismatches by using consistent `'en-US'` locale for all number/date formatting across server and client.
- **Database ORM**: Uses Prisma instead of Drizzle ORM. All database operations have been adapted to work with the existing Prisma schema and client.
- **Cookie Management**: Uses `js-cookie` dependency to maintain sync with upstream template for easier future updates.
- **Component Structure**: All coding agent components are organized under `components/builder/` and `components/auth/` for better organization within the Social Forge structure.
- **API Routes**: All coding agent API routes are prefixed with `/api/builder/` to maintain clear separation from other Social Forge functionality.
- **JWE Encryption**: Added JWE token encryption/decryption utilities in `lib/coding-agent/jwe/` for secure token handling.
- **Utility Functions**: All template utility functions ported to `lib/coding-agent/` with proper Social Forge adaptations.
- **Image Configuration**: Updated Next.js config to support GitHub avatar images and repository assets.
- **Loading States**: Added proper loading and error pages for builder task routes.

### Path Mapping Reference

Template files are mapped to Social Forge locations as follows:

**Shared Utilities** (Intentionally placed in `lib/` for broader use):
- `lib/github-stars.ts` → `lib/github-stars.ts` (GitHub star fetching used across app)
- `lib/utils.ts` (cn() utility) → `lib/utils.ts` (contains cn() plus Social Forge utilities)

**Renamed for Clarity**:
- `lib/hooks/use-task.ts` → `lib/coding-agent/hooks/use-builder-task.ts` (prefixed with "builder")
- `lib/utils/branch-name-generator.ts` → `lib/coding-agent/branch-names.ts` (simplified name)

**Coding Agent Specific** (Under `lib/coding-agent/`):
- Most template `lib/` files → `lib/coding-agent/` (namespaced for organization)
