# Social Forge Marketing Brand Guide

This reference captures the patterns established on the marketing landing page so every new interface matches the same visual language, accessibility requirements, and performance bar. Statements use **MUST**, **SHOULD**, or **NEVER** to indicate priority.

## Essence & Voice
- **MUST** keep messaging direct, expert, and optimistic about earning with AI, mirroring the hero, pricing, and CTA sections.
- **SHOULD** lead with outcomes before features and close each flow with a clear action.
- **NEVER** lean on jargon or casual humor that weakens authority.

## Color System
- **MUST** rely on the existing design tokens (`--background`, `--foreground`, `--primary`, `--muted`, etc.) and ensure APCA-compliant contrast.
- **SHOULD** tint rings and subtle accents with the provided `color-mix` approach, reserving brighter `accent-*` and `heat-*` hues for icon fills and highlights.
- **NEVER** introduce new colors without adding them to the token scale.

## Typography
- **MUST** default to Geist Sans, using Geist Mono/NumberFlow for code snippets or numeric callouts; maintain landing page hierarchy (`text-4xl/5xl` headlines, `text-xl` lead, `text-lg` section copy, `text-sm` UI text).
- **SHOULD** enable `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` wherever numbers are compared.
- **NEVER** depend on placeholder text for meaning; use informative `aria-label`s and illustrative placeholders ending with ellipses.

## Layout & Spacing
- **MUST** center sections within `max-w-5xl`/`max-w-6xl`, apply `px-6` gutters, keep vertical rhythm in 12–24 spacing increments, and retain border rails plus striped separators.
- **SHOULD** use Tailwind `@container` queries for responsive stacking and maintain `rounded-xl/2xl` radii.
- **NEVER** create ad-hoc positioning that breaks the grid or causes unintended scrollbars—verify mobile, laptop, and ultra-wide (50 % zoom) layouts and respect safe areas.

## Core Components
- **MUST** build calls-to-action on existing button variants (primary: indigo fill with soft shadow; outline: card surface) and place key content in cards (`ring-foreground/[0.065]` background, soft shadow).
- **MUST** mirror bento/pricing grid patterns for dense information, keeping generous gaps and masked illustration edges.
- **SHOULD** reuse navigation elements: fixed translucent header with blur, mega-menu, and accordion-based mobile menu.
- **NEVER** ship checkboxes or radios without unified label hit areas, or forms that block paste, spellcheck overrides, or password managers.

## Illustration & Iconography
- **MUST** pair Lucide icons with soft accent fills (`/15` opacity) and preserve ample whitespace; apply masked, perspective illustrations for hero/card visuals.
- **SHOULD** ensure skeleton loaders match final layout and design empty/dense/error states for every surface.
- **NEVER** expose icon-only controls without descriptive `aria-label`s or overlapping text cues.

## Interaction, Motion & Feedback
- **MUST** honor `prefers-reduced-motion`, animate only compositor-friendly properties (opacity/transform), and keep transitions interruptible.
- **SHOULD** delay the first tooltip in a group and show subsequent ones instantly; prefer optimistic updates with undo affordances.
- **NEVER** autoplay motion or disable zoom. Include the viewport meta tag, set `touch-action: manipulation`, and avoid double-tap zoom issues while preserving full pinch zoom.

## Forms & Data Flow
- **MUST** keep inputs hydration-safe, trim values, accept partial submissions, surface inline errors, and focus the first invalid field; show a spinner while preserving the original submit label.
- **SHOULD** disable spellcheck on emails, codes, and usernames; use illustrative placeholders like `sk-012345…`.
- **MUST** warn before navigating away from unsaved edits, allow pasting one-time codes, and use idempotency keys when disabling submits during requests.
- **NEVER** block typing via synchronous validation loops.

## State, Navigation & Content
- **MUST** reflect state in URLs (filters, tabs) using `nuqs` or similar, restore scroll on history navigation, and keep navigation links as semantic `<a>/<Link>` elements supporting Cmd/Ctrl/middle-click.
- **SHOULD** provide inline help before resorting to tooltips, keep `<title>` synced with context, and let right-clicking the logo expose brand assets.
- **MUST** add `scroll-margin-top` to headings, include “Skip to content,” maintain proper heading hierarchy, and glue key terms with non-breaking spaces (e.g., `⌘&nbsp;+&nbsp;K`).

## Performance & Testing
- **MUST** profile with CPU/network throttling, measure without noisy extensions, batch layout reads/writes, virtualize long lists, reserve image space, preload above-the-fold art, and keep mutations under 500 ms.
- **SHOULD** prefer uncontrolled inputs or cheap controlled loops and test in iOS Low Power Mode plus macOS Safari.
- **NEVER** ship without monitoring component re-renders (React DevTools/React Scan) or leave media without explicit sizing that triggers CLS.
