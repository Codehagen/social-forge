Today, we're excited to launch the [Social Forge Help Center](/help)—a single destination for workspace setup guides, AI workflows, and troubleshooting tips.

Since launch, agencies and product teams have peppered us with similar questions through email, chat, and workspace comments. The patterns were clear: _folks wanted quick, self-serve answers_.

We built the Help Center so you can get unstuck instantly—without waiting on a support thread.

## What’s inside the Help Center?

The Help Center is a living library of articles that explain everything from onboarding new clients to automating launches. We update it with every feature release and workflow improvement.

Some popular starting points:

## Lightning-fast search, everywhere in Social Forge

The Help Center ships with fuzzy, typo-tolerant search so you can surface answers in seconds. It scans article titles, headings, and structured metadata.

Best of all, search is available anywhere inside Social Forge—workspace, editor, or Help Center. Hit `⌘K` (`Ctrl+K` on Windows) to open the command palette and search articles without losing focus.

We’re also experimenting with an AI teammate that can route you to the exact section or suggest next steps based on your question:

## Better support for every workspace

The Help Center boosts our support team and gives your crew faster answers. We’ll keep expanding it with fresh guides, templates, and launch checklists.
