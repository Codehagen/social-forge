The Notion integration keeps every stakeholder on the same page the moment a new customer website goes live in Social Forge. Instead of duplicating launch details into a shared workspace, the integration spins up a Notion page with the latest status, assets, and owners automatically.

## The challenge: launch details slip through the cracks

Ramping new customers often means juggling dozens of microsites, stakeholders, and approvals. Without automation, teams waste time on:

1. **Manual updates** – Copying launch summaries, assets, and key dates into Notion after every release.
2. **Scattered feedback** – Chasing comments across email threads or chat instead of keeping them where work happens.
3. **Last-minute handoffs** – Remembering to brief customer-facing teams before the website is ready to send out.

## The solution: Social Forge keeps Notion in sync

Once the integration is enabled, Social Forge turns every new website into a structured Notion page:

1. **Auto-generated launch hubs** – Each publish event creates a templated page that includes hero copy, key links, and launch metadata.
2. **Live status tracking** – Updates to approvals, QA, or content in Social Forge push directly into the Notion page so everyone sees the latest truth.
3. **Ready-to-send checklists** – Action items and owners are mapped into tasks that customer success teams can complete before sharing with the customer.

## The impact: faster handoffs, happier customers

Teams using the Notion integration see immediate benefits:

1. **Zero copy-paste overhead** – Launch details flow into Notion automatically, saving hours every week.
2. **Confident client updates** – Customer-facing teams always have a polished Notion page to send as soon as a site is approved.
3. **Less context switching** – Product, marketing, and delivery teams collaborate in the same workspace they already rely on.

By pairing Social Forge’s launch automation with Notion’s connected workspace, every new website ships with a shareable, always-current home your customers will love.
