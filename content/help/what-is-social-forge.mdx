## Who uses Social Forge?

Social Forge is built for agencies, consultancies, and product teams that need to ship professional sites repeatedly—without spinning up one-off stacks for every project.

Example use cases:

- Marketing agencies delivering recurring redesigns
- Startup teams iterating on landing pages pre-launch
- Enterprise innovation groups piloting microsites
- Freelancers juggling multiple client retainers

## How is Social Forge different from other alternatives?

Social Forge blends AI with opinionated workflows. Instead of a blank prompt or rigid template, you get structured questions, modular components, and instant previews so stakeholders can approve quickly. Everything stays editable—copy, imagery, layout—until you hit publish.

Highlights:

- Guided AI revisions keep designs cohesive across pages.
- Built-in brand controls lock typography, colors, and spacing.
- Multi-project workspaces and roles are included on every plan.
- You can export code or continue hosting on Social Forge—your choice.
